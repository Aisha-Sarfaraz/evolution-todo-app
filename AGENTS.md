# Multi-Agent Architecture Specification

**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** PRODUCTION
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-02
**Authority:** This document is the authoritative specification for all agent behavior in this system.

---

## Purpose of This Document

This document defines the complete multi-agent architecture governing the Spec-Driven Todo Application. It serves as the **single source of truth** for agent responsibilities, execution order, blocking authority, and governance rules.

### Why This Document Exists

1. **Governance Authority**: Establishes which agents have blocking power and under what conditions
2. **Execution Clarity**: Defines the mandatory sequence for agent invocation
3. **Scope Enforcement**: Prevents agents from exceeding their defined responsibilities
4. **Future Reusability**: Enables architecture reuse across different application domains
5. **Compliance Framework**: Ensures Claude Code operates within architectural constraints

### How This Governs Execution

All work performed by Claude Code in this repository **must** comply with this specification. No agent may:
- Execute outside its defined scope
- Block work without proper authority
- Skip required predecessor agents
- Modify or remove established governance rules

**No work can happen outside this system.** All implementation, validation, and coordination must flow through the agents defined herein.

---

## Agent Taxonomy

The multi-agent system is organized into four distinct categories, each with specific roles and authorities.

### Governance Agents

**Purpose:** Enforce project methodology and quality standards
**Authority:** Full blocking power to halt execution until compliance is achieved
**Characteristics:**
- Validate process adherence (SDD, TDD)
- Block work that violates methodology
- No implementation responsibility
- No skill ownership

### Design / Guidance Agents

**Purpose:** Define architectural contracts and design patterns
**Authority:** Advisory only (recommend, do not block)
**Characteristics:**
- Design taxonomies and patterns
- Provide architectural guidance
- Do not implement code
- No skill ownership

### Domain Agents

**Purpose:** Protect domain correctness and business logic integrity
**Authority:** Blocking power to prevent domain pollution
**Characteristics:**
- Define and validate domain models
- Enforce domain invariants
- Block infrastructure concerns from entering domain
- No skill ownership (reasoning agents)

### Operational Agents

**Purpose:** Execute implementation, coordination, and validation workflows
**Authority:** Variable (some can block on specific violations)
**Characteristics:**
- Implement features across system layers
- Coordinate multi-layer workflows
- Execute repeatable operational tasks
- May own skills for repeatable workflows

---

## Global Rules (Non-Negotiable)

The following rules apply to **all agents** without exception:

### Rule 1: Spec-Driven Development (SDD) Mandate

**No implementation without approved specification.**

All feature work must have:
- Approved `spec.md` (requirements and acceptance criteria)
- Approved `plan.md` (architecture and design decisions)
- Approved `tasks.md` (atomic, testable tasks)

**Enforced By:** Spec Governance Enforcer
**Consequence of Violation:** Immediate work stoppage

### Rule 2: Test-Driven Development (TDD) Mandate

**No code without tests written first.**

All implementation must follow Red-Green-Refactor:
1. **Red:** Write failing test (user approval required)
2. **Green:** Implement minimal code to pass test
3. **Refactor:** Improve code while tests remain green

**Enforced By:** Test Strategy Architect
**Consequence of Violation:** Implementation blocked

### Rule 3: Scope Adherence

**No agent may exceed its defined scope.**

Each agent has explicit boundaries. Agents must:
- Operate only within their defined scope
- Delegate work outside their scope to appropriate agents
- Never reimplement logic owned by another agent

**Enforced By:** All agents (self-governance)
**Consequence of Violation:** Architecture integrity violation

### Rule 4: Blocking Authority Hierarchy

**Only designated agents may block execution.**

Blocking authority is explicitly granted. Agents without blocking authority:
- May advise and recommend
- May warn of issues
- **Cannot** halt execution

**Authority Definition:** See Agent Definitions section

### Rule 5: Context7 MCP Usage

**Agents must use Context7 MCP for external documentation.**

The following agents **must** use Context7 MCP tool to fetch latest documentation:
- Better Auth Guardian (for Better Auth APIs)
- Next.js Frontend Architect (for Next.js 16 documentation)

Agents **must not** rely on internal knowledge for framework-specific APIs or patterns.

**Rationale:** Prevents outdated or incorrect information from entering the system.

---

## Agent Invocation Order

Agents execute in a **sequential workflow** following the CrewAI Process.sequential pattern. Each agent receives output from the previous agent and passes validated results to the next.

### Standard Execution Sequence

```
1. Spec Governance Enforcer
   ↓ (validates spec exists and is complete)
2. Domain Guardian
   ↓ (validates domain model changes)
3. Data & Schema Guardian
   ↓ (designs database schema aligned with domain)
4. Python Backend Architect (if backend changes needed)
   ↓ (implements application logic)
5. Next.js Frontend Architect (if frontend changes needed)
   ↓ (implements user interface)
6. Better Auth Guardian (if auth changes needed)
   ↓ (defines auth requirements)
7. Error & Reliability Architect (always runs)
   ↓ (reviews error handling - advisory)
8. Test Strategy Architect (always runs)
   ↓ (validates TDD compliance)
9. Integration Orchestrator (always runs)
   └─ (validates end-to-end integration)
```

### Execution Semantics

**STOP:** Critical failure. Execution halts immediately. Requires remediation before proceeding.
- Triggered by blocking agents when violations detected
- No downstream agents execute
- User intervention required

**BLOCK:** Agent refuses to approve work until issues resolved.
- Triggered by blocking authority agents
- Work cannot proceed until remediation complete
- Downstream agents do not execute

**ADVISE:** Agent provides recommendations but does not halt execution.
- Triggered by advisory agents (Error & Reliability Architect)
- Work may proceed
- Recommendations should be addressed but are not mandatory

### Conditional Execution

Not all agents run for every feature:
- **Backend Architect:** Only if backend changes required
- **Frontend Architect:** Only if frontend changes required
- **Better Auth Guardian:** Only if auth changes required
- **Error Architect, Test Architect, Integration Orchestrator:** Always run

## Skill Governance Rules

Skills represent **repeatable operational workflows** executed by operational agents. The following rules govern skill creation, ownership, and usage.

### Rule 1: Skill Ownership Restriction

**Skills may ONLY be owned by Operational Agents.**

Governance, Design/Guidance, and Domain agents **must not** own skills because:
- Governance agents validate process (not operational)
- Design agents define contracts (not operational)
- Domain agents reason about correctness (not operational)

Only operational agents execute repeatable workflows that justify skill creation.

### Rule 2: Skill Definition Standards

All skills must:
- Represent a **repeatable workflow** (not one-time tasks)
- Have a **single, focused responsibility**
- Be **domain-agnostic** (reusable across projects)
- Include clear **inputs, outputs, and constraints**
- Be versioned and documented

### Rule 3: Skill Immutability

**Existing skills must NEVER be modified or removed without governance approval.**

Changes to skills require:
1. Justification for change
2. Impact analysis on dependent agents
3. Governance review
4. User approval

### Rule 4: New Skill Creation

New skills may only be created if:
1. Owned by an operational agent
2. Represent a repeatable workflow (used 3+ times)
3. Do not duplicate existing skill functionality
4. Approved by Spec Governance Enforcer

---

## Agent ↔ Skill Mapping

**Total Skills:** 8
**Total Agents:** 10
**Agents with Skills:** 2 (Data & Schema Guardian, Integration Orchestrator)

## Enforcement & Compliance

### Scope Violation Protocol

If an agent attempts to exceed its defined scope:

1. **Detection:** Monitoring agent or user identifies violation
2. **Immediate Halt:** Violating agent's execution is stopped
3. **Escalation:** Violation reported to Spec Governance Enforcer
4. **Remediation:** Work delegated to correct agent
5. **Audit Trail:** Violation logged in project governance records

### Blocking Agent Execution

When a blocking agent issues a block:

1. **Block Issued:** Agent clearly states blocking reason and severity
2. **Downstream Halt:** All downstream agents do not execute
3. **Remediation Required:** User or appropriate agent must fix violation
4. **Re-Validation:** Blocking agent must re-validate after remediation
5. **Resume:** Workflow resumes only after block cleared

### Advisory Agent Execution

When an advisory agent provides recommendations:

1. **Advisory Issued:** Agent provides warnings and recommendations
2. **Execution Continues:** Downstream agents proceed
3. **User Decision:** User decides whether to address advisory
4. **No Block:** Advisory agents cannot halt execution

### Claude Code Compliance

Claude Code must:
- Invoke agents in correct sequence per invocation order
- Respect blocking authority (halt on BLOCK)
- Delegate work to appropriate agents based on scope
- Use Context7 MCP when required (Better Auth Guardian, Next.js Frontend Architect)
- Never skip governance agents (Spec Governance, Test Strategy)
- Follow TDD mandate (tests before code)
- Follow SDD mandate (specs before implementation)

---

## Future Evolution Policy

This architecture is designed for long-term scalability and domain independence. The following policies govern future changes.

### Adding New Agents

New agents may be added if:

1. **Non-Overlapping Responsibility:** New agent has unique, non-overlapping scope
2. **Clear Agent Type:** Classified as Governance, Design/Guidance, Domain, or Operational
3. **Blocking Authority Justified:** If blocking power requested, justification required
4. **Integration Defined:** Handoff contracts with existing agents specified
5. **Governance Approval:** Spec Governance Enforcer approves addition
6. **Documentation Updated:** AGENTS.md, AGENT_OWNERSHIP_MATRIX.md, AGENT_INVOCATION_PROTOCOL.md updated

### Swapping Domains

The architecture supports domain swapping:

1. **Generic Agents Remain:** All non-domain agents (Backend, Frontend, Schema, Integration, etc.) remain unchanged
2. **Domain Guardian Reconfigured:** Domain Guardian's DOMAIN_NAME and CORE_ENTITY placeholders updated
3. **Domain-Specific Agent Replaced:** Core Todo Domain replaced with new domain-specific agent (e.g., Core E-Commerce Domain)
4. **Domain Model Redefined:** New domain model, invariants, and lifecycle defined
5. **Schema Regenerated:** Data & Schema Guardian generates new schema for new domain
6. **Tests Updated:** Test Strategy Architect validates new domain tests

**Example:** Swap Todo Domain → E-Commerce Domain
- Replace: Core Todo Domain → Core E-Commerce Domain
- Reconfigure: Domain Guardian (DOMAIN_NAME = "E-Commerce", CORE_ENTITY = "Order")
- Preserve: All other 8 agents remain unchanged

### Layering LifeOps AI

Future LifeOps AI integration:

1. **Non-Breaking Addition:** LifeOps AI layered **on top** of existing architecture
2. **New Agents Created:** LifeOps-specific agents (e.g., Routine Automation Agent, Context Synthesis Agent)
3. **Existing Agents Preserved:** Core 10 agents remain unchanged
4. **Integration Protocol Defined:** LifeOps agents integrate via Integration Orchestrator
5. **Governance Respected:** LifeOps agents subject to Spec Governance and Test Strategy enforcement

**Principle:** LifeOps AI **augments** the system without **replacing** core agents.
